<b>Boolean</b>

Basically Boolean refers to true and false values.
  
<p>TRUE | FALSE</p>
<p>ON   | OFF</p>
<p>1    | 0</p>

<b>Binary System (2s Number System)</b>

The Binary system consists of 2 numbers, 1 and 0. Decimal numbers can be represented by Binary numbers. In order for us to write numbers in the Binary system, we would have to convert it from the 10s or Decimal system. To convert Decimal numbers to Binary numbers, repetitive division of 2 is used. The remainder is also taken into account.

For example:

(521)<sub>10</sub> ---x (?)<sub>2</sub>

Solution:

521/2 = 260R1

260/2 = 130R0

130/2 = 65R0

65/2 = 32R1

32/2 = 16R0

16/2 = 8R0

8/2 = 4R0

4/2 = 2R0

2/2 = 1R0

Once the number has been divided till the answer is 1, the number equivalent in Binary would be 1, with the remainders taken into accout concatenated behind it. In this case, the number becomes 1000001001 in the Binary system.

Thus,

(521)<sub>10</sub> ---x (1000001001)<sub>2</sub>
